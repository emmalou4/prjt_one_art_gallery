## Future Enhancements
I would add more functionality to the app and make it more interactive and eye-catching. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to connect the API and thought that with all the different styles of artwork a simpler cleaner layout would compliment that well. Next time I would have the art information along with the photograph pop up in a text-box and I would make the layout sleaker. I would also add more information on the art pieces and links to their bios, background on the era's when the art was produced, what tools did they use to create the art piece, and much more information about the artist/artwork.
